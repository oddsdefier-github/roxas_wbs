## Project Overview
The Water Billing System is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline and automate the billing processes of water utility providers. This project aims to enhance access to water by offering a robust platform for managing billing and payment services, ensuring efficient operations for community services, establishments, and organizations.

## Technologies Used
- PHP: Server-side scripting
- JavaScript: Client-side scripting

- MySQL: Database management

## Features
- User-friendly interface for both administrators and customers.
- Automated billing calculations based on water usage.
- Secure login and user management system.
- Payment gateway integration for easy bill settlements.
- Seamless client addition with a verification and approval system that allows for initial application encoding, review, and finalization upon payment.

- Data analytics for usage patterns and financial reporting.

## Milestones & Upcoming Features

### Achieved Milestones
- Client-side validation for sign-in and client addition through JS Validate.
- Integration of search, filter, and pagination features.
- Insertion of client data into the MySQL database with error checking and prevention of duplicates.
- A notification system that alerts the admin when clients pay for applications, enabling prompt approval.
- Distinct portals for different user roles: Admin, Cashier, and Meter Reader.
- Cashiers can now confirm payments for billing and applications.
- Meter Readers are able to input data, with ongoing development for verification and billing generation.

### What Users Can Expect in Future Updates
- Notifications for cashiers when there is a new application.
- The ability for cashiers to verify billing data before it is added to their billing data table.
- Generation of comprehensive reports, including monthly usage statistics, revenue generated by the system, and active/inactive user counts.
- Integration of PHPMailer for sending approval notifications, billing reminders, and electronic billing to clients.

The developer is continuously working to enhance the Water Billing System. He welcome feedback and suggestions that can help improve the system for all users.


## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up a MySQL database and import the provided SQL schema.
3. Configure your PHP environment:
   - Edit the `php.ini` file to enable extensions required by `dompdf`. Specifically, ensure the following lines are uncommented:
     ```
     extension=mbstring
     extension=gd
     ```
     This will enable multibyte string processing and image processing capabilities which are necessary for PDF generation.
   - Connect the application to the database by editing the appropriate configuration files.
4. Install necessary JavaScript and CSS dependencies.
5. Run the system on a local server or deploy to a live server.

## Usage
After setting up the project, navigate to the homepage and log in with your credentials. Administrators can manage billing cycles, user data, and view reports. Customers can check their bill status, and usage history.
